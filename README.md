# Disable JavaScript
This web extension lets a user decide if JavaScript should be enabled or disabled for a given host or a given tab.  

When accessing e.g. [google.com](https://www.google.com/) and disabling JavaScript, the web extension will block all JavaScript
which otherwise would be loaded by google.com (including inline JS and external JS files from other hosts).  

Please note that scripts from the blacklisted host will still be loaded if they're being loaded in **another**
host _(unless you block that host as well of course)_.
 
## Supported browsers
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disable-javascript/) (Desktop & Firefox for Android)
- [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-javascript/jfpdlihdedhlmhlbgooailmfhahieoem) (Desktop)

## Usage
Disabling and enabling JavaScript should be pretty self-explanatory.  
The icons and labels update for a tab accordingly.  

**NOTE:** On Firefox for Android, no icon will be shown but toggling is possible via a menu item.  
See the [Add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disable-javascript/) for screenshots.

## Why to use this web extension
The code is completely **open source**, you can also use the unpacked version of this web extension if you prefer.
